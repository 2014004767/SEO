Search Engine Optimisation in 2017 is a technical, analytical and creative process to improve the visibility of a website in search engines. Its primary function is to drive more visits to a site that convert into sales. Google insists webmasters adhere to their ‘rules’ and aims to reward sites with high-quality content and remarkable ‘white hat’ web marketing techniques with high rankings.
The art of web SEO lies in understanding how people search for things and understanding what type of results Google wants to (or will) display to its users. It’s about putting a lot of things together to look for opportunity. A good optimiser has an understanding of how search engines like Google generate their natural SERPs to satisfy users’ navigational, informational and transactional keyword queries.

In my project work, I have prepared Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) of the website, which helps in the designing structure of the web content 
HTML DOM structure is kept in mind while creating the CSS , because any search engine prior (give preferenc) to our web-site , only when it follows the DOM strurture , for eg <div> tag is considered as the low level of hierarchy while element node occupies the root , so in my CSS , Designing Structure follows a MVC pattern , and independent classes are defined for element , attribute and text nodes.
